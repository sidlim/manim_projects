Here's a repository full of math animation scenes! My goal is to take this content and use it to explain math & its applications in a clinical setting. Examples include diagnosing eye disease by looking at how "wavy" (measuring tortuousity & curvature) or "branchy" (measuring fractal dimension) the blood vessels in the back of the eye are, or understanding how we look for mutations that cause disease. 

So far, I've focused on explaining the math concepts, so this is all pure math stuff. Have some examples:
Euler Integration with a large step size:

Here's what happens when you halve the step size:
